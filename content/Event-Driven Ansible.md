# How to Start with Event-Driven Ansible

Event-Driven Ansible (EDA) introduces a powerful approach to automation by reacting to real-time events. In this post, we’ll explore what EDA is, how it works, and provide a step-by-step guide to setting up your first EDA environment.

---

## What is Event-Driven Ansible?

Event-Driven Ansible allows you to automate tasks based on triggers from various event sources, such as webhooks, monitoring tools, or metrics from systems like Prometheus. This enables dynamic, real-time responses to changing infrastructure conditions.

---

## Why Use Event-Driven Ansible?

- **Proactive Automation**: Instead of reactive tasks, anticipate and address issues automatically.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Integrate with tools like ServiceNow, Kafka, or custom webhooks.
- **Efficiency**: Reduce manual intervention with dynamic playbooks and remediations.

---

## Setting Up Event-Driven Ansible

### Prerequisites
- Ansible Automation Controller installed.
- Access to an event source (e.g., Kafka, ServiceNow, or a webhook endpoint).
- Familiarity with playbooks and YAML syntax.

### Step 1: Install EDA
To install the Event-Driven Ansible Collection:
```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install ansible.eda
```

### Step 2: Create a Rulebook
Define your automation triggers in a rulebook:
```yaml
---
- name: Monitor Service Health
  hosts: localhost
  sources:
    - ansible.eda.webhook:
        host: 0.0.0.0
        port: 5000
  rules:
    - name: Restart a service on failure
      condition: event['service_status'] == 'failed'
      action:
        run_playbook:
          name: restart_service.yml
```

### Step 3: Test the Rulebook
Start the EDA engine to process events:
```bash
ansible-rulebook --rulebook rulebook.yml --inventory inventory.yml
```

---

## Real-World Use Case: Auto-Healing Infrastructure

Imagine you’re managing a Kubernetes cluster, and a pod fails. Using Event-Driven Ansible, you can:
1. Detect the failure via Prometheus.
2. Trigger a webhook to Ansible Automation Controller.
3. Execute a remediation playbook to restart the pod or redeploy resources.

---

## Conclusion

Event-Driven Ansible brings agility and scalability to automation workflows. Whether you're managing cloud infrastructure, on-premise servers, or hybrid environments, EDA helps you stay ahead of the curve.
